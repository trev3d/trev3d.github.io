			Website info

		<p>
			This site was written from scratch, half out of being too prideful to use a template, and half out of wanting to learn to build sites. It likely breaks many conventions and best practices in web design, but its functional.

		<p>
			I use
			<a href="https://www.exljbris.com/museoslab.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exljbris Font Foundry's Museo Slab</a>
			for heading text and
			<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastian Kosch's Crimson Text</a>
			for everything else. I don't know if these font choices obey whatever typography fundamentals in web design there are. I just eyeballed it, thinking they look nice :)
