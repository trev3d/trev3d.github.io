			LittleBigPlanet Restitched
		</h2>

		<p>
			A fangame of the LittleBigPlanet series. This began as an experiment with <a href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angus Johnson's ClipperLib library</a>.
			I invited an established group of LittleBigPlanet level builders and artists called
			<a href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trixel Creative</a>
			to help turn it into a full game.
		</p>
		<p>
			We got pretty far together, eventually uploading a Youtube trailer collecting half a million views.
			<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-11-inside-the-littlebigplanet-pc-fan-game-sony-shut-down-with-a-cease-and-desist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The game was covered by Eurogamer</a> and a few other gaming news sites.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sony, who owns the LittleBigPlanet IP, wasn't pleased with us and asked us to stop development. The project lives on under a new name and branding, but I'm no longer involved with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was primarily responsible for the level creation system which involved procedural geometry generation and tricky body grouping/separation behavior (where objects 'glued' together would behave as one physics body). I also helped with the artistic side of things in creating promotional renders, setting up environment lighting, and creating in-game models.
