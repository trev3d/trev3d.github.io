                Non-linear deformers were used to create the cymbals, curved half-pipes, springs, 
                pendulums, and the wavy platform toward the end of the level.

                This is a playable version of the marble level built in Unity.

                Because the controls are untuned and some parts of the level are tricky,
                you can cycle through checkpoints with the button in the top-left.

                There are some areas that could use polish. Notably, anything other than
                the wooden blocks lacks texture, there are no light/reflection probes, the alpha-blended
                clouds sometimes switch draw order, and static objects do not cast shadows on dynamic
                objects (such as the spring things at the beginning of the video). Still, I'm very happy
                with how this turned out.
