	<h2>tl;dr</h2>
	
	<p>
		<i>Lasertag</i> (one word) is an experiment in reducing the friction
		of mixed reality games. 
		The goal is to make something that is super flexible and 'just works.'
		
	<p>
		It requires little prior setup, progressively maps and syncs room 'geometry'
		(height, really) between all players over the network, and connects headsets
		to games automatically.
		
	<p>
		The game runs on Meta Quest 3/3s and is built on Unity using their
		first-party Netcode for GameObjects package. You can try the game 
		<a href="https://www.meta.com/s/59aIPXxXi" target="_blank">
		here >>>
		</a>
		
	<h2>simple setup</h2>
	
	<p>
		In order to play, players must do the following:
	
	<ul>
		<li>1. Everyone puts on their headset
		<li>2. Everyone connects to the same wifi network
		<li>3. Everyone launches the app
		<li>4. One person presses the 'host' button
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		From there, all nearby headsets (should) connect and colocate automatically.
		Limitations are detailed in '<a href="#known_issues">known issues</a>.'
		
	<h2>progressive network-synced environment mapping</h2>

	</div>
		
	<p>
		The game uses Quest's built-in depth estimation API to progressively and
		collectively map the playspace for laser collision.
		Headsets stream their scan to other headsets and they all
		build a shared heightmap as they move around.
		
	<p>
		This way, even if Headset #1 isn't close enough to scan what Headset #2 
		is hiding behind, #1 will know something is in the way.
		
	<p>
		There is no 'environment mesh' (except for debug visuals).
		
	<h2>depth lighting</h2>
	
	<div class="webvid">

	</div>
	
	<p>
		Laser's lights are inverted sphere meshes with a depth/normal-sampling shader.
		They're like rudimentary deferred point lights.
		
	<p>
		These are expensive due to alpha blending and 
		I still need to optimize them.
		
	<h2 id="known_issues">known issues</h2>
	
	<p>
		The game still has many problems I need to solve:
	
	<ul>
		<li>Headsets must be on the same subnet to connect.
		<ul><li>I plan to fall back onto Unity's first party relay service
		when necessary.</ul>
		<li>Meta's shared anchors are finicky. Sometimes they won't upload or download.
			<ul><li>Meta anchors are a cloud service 
			and require a decent internet connection.
			<li>I plan to use keyboard tracking as an alternative
			colocation solution.
			</ul>
		<li>Players' virtual avatars will drift and dislocate
		from their real bodies over time.
		<li>Playspace map syncing will occasionally cause app crashes.
		<li>Depth-lights, being alpha-blended & often full-screen, are slow.
		<li>Distant lasers and avatars are invisible due to limited depth-occlusion
		range.
		<li>The playspace mapper will see and add players to the heightmap.
		<li>The mapper generally needs better filtering and validation.
		<li>All of the visuals are placeholders.
	</ul>
		
	<h2>download</h2>
	
	<p>
		The game is still pretty bare-bones. 
		There are no objectives, rounds, teams, etc.
		Only you, your friends, and laser guns.
