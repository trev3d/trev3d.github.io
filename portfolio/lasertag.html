	<h2>tl;dr</h2>
	
	<p>
		<i>Lasertag</i> (one word) is an experiment in reducing the friction
		of mixed reality games with something that 'just works.'
		
	<p>
		It requires little prior setup, progressively scans and syncs room geometry
		between all players over the network, 
		and connects nearby headsets automatically.
		
	<p>
		The game runs on Meta Quest 3/3s and is built on Unity using their
		first-party Netcode for GameObjects package. You can try the game 
		<a href="https://www.meta.com/s/59aIPXxXi" target="_blank">
		here >>>
		</a>
		
	<h2>simple setup</h2>
	
	<p>
		In order to play, players must do the following:
	
	<ul>
		<li>1. Everyone puts on their headset
		<li>2. Everyone connects to the same wifi network
		<li>3. Everyone launches the app
		<li>4. One person presses the 'host' button
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		From there, all nearby headsets (should) connect and colocate automatically.
		Limitations are detailed in '<a href="#known_issues">known issues</a>.'
		
	<h2>progressive network-synced environment mapping</h2>
			
	<div class="webvid">

	</div>
		
	<p>
		The app uses Quest's depth estimation to progressively and
		collectively map the playspace for laser collision via compute kernels.
		Headsets stream their scans to other headsets and they all
		add to a shared heightmap.
		
	<p>
		This way, even if Headset #1 isn't close enough to scan what Headset #2 
		is hiding behind, #1 will still know that something is there because #2
		will stream its scan.

		
	<h2>depth lighting</h2>
	
	<div class="webvid">

	</div>
	
	<p>
		Laser's lights are inverted sphere meshes with a depth/normal-sampling shader.
		They're like rudimentary deferred point lights.
		
	<p>
		These are expensive 
		(alpha blended fragments that often overlap and cover the whole view)
		and I still need to optimize them.
		
	<h2 id="known_issues">known issues</h2>
	
	<p>
		The game still has many problems I need to solve:
	
	<ul>
		<li>Headsets must be on the same subnet to connect.
		<li>Meta's shared anchors are finicky and often fail.
		<li>Players' virtual avatars will drift and dislocate
		from their real bodies over time.
		<li>Playspace map syncing will occasionally cause crashes.
		<li>Depth-lights are unoptimized.
		<li>Distant lasers and avatars are invisible due to limited depth-occlusion
		range.
		<li>The playspace mapper will add other players' bodies to the heightmap.
		<li>The mapper generally needs better filtering and validation.
		<li>All of the visuals are placeholders.
	</ul>
		
	<h2>download</h2>
	
	<p>
		The game is still pretty bare-bones. 
		There are no objectives, rounds, teams, etc.
		Only you, your friends, and laser guns.
