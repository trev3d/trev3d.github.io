	<p>
		I want mixed reality to be more than just a gimmick;
		I want games that don't just exist in your environment,
		but respond to it and take advantage of it. 
		
		I also want games that encourage physical movement
		and real-life socializing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This prototype is my effort to make such a game.
		It is a co-located multiplayer mixed reality app that turns any space
		into a large-scale laser tag arena for you and your friends.

	<h3><br>environment depth understanding</h3>

	<p>
		Laser bullets hit real objects using the headset's live 
		depth understanding, so there is no need for each user to spend time
		pre-scanning their environment. 
		Players are meant to run around and duck behind cover in their physical space.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This technique does have a major drawback:
		players can't hit what the headset can't see, 
		so you can't shoot around corners or behind yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, this technique doesn't require that each player
		spend several minutes carefully scan the space.
		Using live depth makes setup much faster and more convenient.
	</p>
	
	<h3><br>starting a match</h3>

	<p>
		Trying to connect several friends manually is cumbersome.
		Starting a game should be frictionless, so
		the headsets automatically list game hosts on the local network. 
	</p>
	
	<h3><br>colocation anchors</h3>
	
	<video autoplay muted playsinline loop

	<p>
		All the headset orientations sync up automatically.
		The host drops and syncs spatial anchors
		as they move around, giving the other headsets
		absolute reference points to spatially calibrate to.
	</p>
