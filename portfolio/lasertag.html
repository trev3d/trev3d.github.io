	<p>
		I want mixed reality to be more than just a gimmick;
		I want games that don't just 'exist' in your physical environment,
		but respond to it and use it as part of the experience. 
		
		I also want games that encourage physical movement
		and real-life socializing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This MR laser tag prototype is my effort to make such a game.
		It is a co-located multiplayer MR game that turns any physical space
		into a large-scale laser tag arena for you and your friends. 
	</p>
	
	<h3><br>environment depth understanding</h3>

	<p>
		Laser bullets hit real objects using the headset's live 
		depth understanding, so there is no need for each user to spend time
		pre-scanning their environment. 
		Players are meant to run around and duck behind cover in their physical space.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This technique does have a major drawback:
		players can't hit what the headset can't see, 
		so you can't shoot around corners or behind yourself.
		However, this technique doesn't require room scanning
		which would take a long time.
		Using live depth makes setup much faster and more convenient.
	</p>
	
	<h3><br>starting a match</h3>

	<p>
		Reciting your IP to your friends, 
		waiting for them to enter it, 
		and trying to help them because it won't work isn't fun.
		Starting a game should be frictionless, so
		the headsets automatically find game hosts using UDP broadcasts. 
	</p>
	
	<h3><br>colocation anchors</h3>

	<p>
		All the headset orientations sync up automatically.
		The host headset automatically drops and syncs spatial anchors
		as it moves around, giving the other headsets
		absolute orientations to spatially calibrate to.

	<h3><br>third party art assets</h3>

		I'm using these assets as placeholders until I create custom assets:
