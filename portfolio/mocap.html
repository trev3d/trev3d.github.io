	<p>
		This is a work-in-progress demo of a colocated VR multiplayer dueling game.
		Two players face off with physical foam swords inside of a motion capture setup.
		The capture data is streamed to the headsets to create visuals that match up
		spatially to what is happening in real life.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I would love to show this game in action, the motion capture system
		I am currently borrowing is currently configured for another project.
		This demo video shows previously recorded data streamed from Motive
		into Unity.

		I used several CC0 assets from <a href="polyhaven.com" target="_blank">PolyHaven.com</a>
		and <a href="ambientcg.com" target="_blank">AmbientCG.com</a> to create a generic
		lava planet. A scrolling noise offset to the lava river's UVs gives the backdrop
		some life.
