	<p>
		This is a virtual lab project led by Purdue University Prof. Stylianos Chatzidakis.
		The lab is built on Unity, and I'm responsible for nearly all visuals and programming.
		It runs in a browser and increases accessibility to curriculum-necessary lab equipment.
	</p>

	<p>
		Users don't interface with 2D abstractions but instead 
		press buttons, flip switches, and turn knobs on accurate 3D representations.
		After using this virtual lab, a student should be able to easily
		use the real thing.
		<!-- I decorated these models with the same labels, stickers, stains, 
		and scratches that grace their real counterparts. -->
	</p>
	<p>
		The program runs in a browser and is optimized for low-spec devices
		such as Chromebooks and tablets.
		There are max 25k triangles rendered in 22 draw events.
		The program's load size is shy of 50mb.
	</p>

	<p>
		I collaborated with Prof. Chatzidakis and his team to
		program fully-functional simulations of the equipment.
		The program is a flexible 'sandbox' that will deal with any 
		arrangements the user may configure.
		Inputs & outputs are fully simulated and everything interacts realistically.
	</p>
	<!-- <p>
		A lot of thought went into this program's architecture, 
		leading to modular systems that communicate through delegates and Unity events.
		I've already reused many of them for other virtual lab projects
		because of how modular these systems are.
		Only a fraction of these scripts are truly specific to this virtual lab 
		and couldn't be useful in other projects.
	</p> -->

	<!-- <p>
		I am continuing to collaborate with Prof. Chatzidakis and his team 
		to expand the lab with more equipment and to cover more of his curriculum.
		I am also working on detailed documentation so that
		other developers may start building off of it.
	</p> -->
	
	<p>
		While I was responsible for most programming and artwork, 
		I still used some third party assets.
		The cable dynamics come from 
		<a href="http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/" target="_blank">Obi Rope</a>,
		and the radioactive source container model comes from 
		<a href="https://polyhaven.com/a/Barrel_01" target="_blank">PolyHaven</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The lab is built in Unity and I created most of the visuals using in Blender,
		Substance Painter, Marmoset Toolbag, and Affinity Designer.
