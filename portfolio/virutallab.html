	<h2>tl;dr</h2>
	<p>
		This is an educational virtual lab project 
		where I'm responsible for all design, artwork, and (nearly all) programming.
		I built the lab on Unity and created the visuals
		with Blender, Marmoset Toolbag, Substance Painter, and Affinity Designer.
		The project was led by Purdue University Prof. Stylianos Chatzidakis to increase
		access to curriculum-necessary lab equipment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Completed late 2023
	</p>

		These models are tightly integrated into the program
		since I am also responsible for the Unity project.
		Some examples:
		<ul>
			<li>The models have less texel density on faces that I know
				are mostly obscured or unseen.
			<li>Lighting is baked directly into equipment textures using 
				Blender / Cycles since each only appears once. 
				Static elements use these textures with a simple unlit material. 
			<li>I created specific reflection cubemaps for many non-static 
				buttons and dials to eliminate incorrect specular highlights.
			<li>Some non-static draggable objects cast custom soft-shadow decals.
			<li>I prepared the models for the line graph &amp; histogram shaders I wrote.
	</ul>

	<p>
		After learning with this virtual lab, a student should 
		easily be able to use the real equipment, 
		as these virtual tools are close matches to their real counterparts
		both visually and functionally. 
		I made several visits to the lab while working on these assets
		to use the real equipment myself and record plenty of reference material.

	<p>
		The lab runs in a browser and is optimized for low-spec devices
		such as Chromebooks and tablets.
		There are max 25,000 triangles rendered across 22 draw events.
		The lab's load size is just under 50mb.

	<h2>programming</h2>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/editor2.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/editor2.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		Built on Unity, I'm responsible for most of this project's scripting.
		This includes the UI, 3D equipment controls, object manipulation, 
		cable management, camera framing, and data graphing. 
		Like the 3D artwork, everything is profiled and optimized for low-spec devices.
		I had help with simulating the equipment, and the cable physics come from 
		<a href="http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/" target="_blank">Obi Rope</a>.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Signal processing and equipment simulation:</h3>
	
	<p>
		All of the lab tools are fully functional
		and process simulated signals. 
		Together with Prof. Chatzidakis and his team, 
		we modeled these devices in C#.
		Signal processing is currently done on the CPU built into WebAssembly
		(although I want to reimplement these as shaders in the future).
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/editor.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/editor.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		The lab targets 100,000 samples per second,
		each of those being signals processed by the equipment.
		As a Unity web app targeting maximum compatibility,
		its limited to a single CPU core with no support for Unity's
		BURST compiler. Performance is more than acceptable,
		but it took plenty of profiling to get there.
	</p>

	<p>
		Signals are function call stacks that the user builds by connecting up equipment.
		Signal structs implement an interface with a function that takes 
		float time (seconds) and returns a float energy (voltage).
		These are not pure functions as the equipment controls drive
		equipment-specific variables that affect the output of these functions.
		I avoid using delegates as they can easily create garbage if used improperly
		and other developers may expand the lab in the future.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Cable visuals and performance:</h3>
	
	<p>
		The cables, with physics by  
		<a href="http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/" target="_blank">Obi Rope</a>,
		presented many problems.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		Mesh updates are extremely expensive according to my profiling.
		Instead of a mesh cylinder, I use a flat ribbon
		with a cylindrical normal texture to minimize the vertices Obi needs to move. 
		I eventually want to add end cap vertices for a better cylinder look.
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/cables.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/cables.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		I randomize cable colors so users can keep track of
		what is connected to what.
		All the cables use a single material and I change the vertex
		colors on cable meshes when they spawn.
		
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/dither.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/dither.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		The cables also become semi-transparent via dithering
		when they may obscure important elements.
	</p>
		
	<br>
	<h3>User experience in 3D:</h3>
		
	<p>
		Building good UX around the rest of the equipment's 3D controls was also a challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
		To prevent users from losing objects, 
		the user cannot drop objects behind UI elements,
		outside of the camera bounds, or while the camera is moving.
		Held objects position using rigidbody-casts so that they don't 
		visually clip into their surroundings.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Supporting a variety of devices means supporting a variety of aspect ratios. 
		I wrote an editor tool for creating camera 'frames' which position the camera 
		so that everything fits into view regardless of aspect ratio. 
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/editor3.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/editor3.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		The controls must be large enough for the user to easily
		interact with them, so the different camera frames are arranged to 
		keep these controls at sane sizes. 
		The equipment is also arranged to keep related frames
		and controls within reach of one another.
	</p>

	<!--<p>
		The only scripting that I wasn't entirely responsible for
		was the equipment signal processing code.
		I collaborated with Prof. Chatzidakis and his team to
		model this equipment as I am neither an 
		electrical engineer nor one of his nuclear engineering students.
		I also wasn't responsible for the cable dynamics, as these are done with
		<a href="http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/" target="_blank">Obi Rope</a>.
