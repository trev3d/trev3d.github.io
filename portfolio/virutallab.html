	<h2>tl;dr</h2>
	<p>
		This is an educational virtual lab project 
		where I'm responsible for nearly all visuals and programming.
		I built the lab on Unity and created most of the visuals
		with Blender, Marmoset Toolbag, and Substance Painter.
		The project was led by Purdue University Prof. Stylianos Chatzidakis to increase
		access to curriculum-necessary lab equipment.
	</p>

		These models are tightly integrated into the program
		since I am also responsible for the Unity project.
		Some examples:
		<ul>
			<li>The models have less texel density on faces that I know
				are mostly obscured or unseen.
			<li>I wrote the line graph &amp; histogram shaders
				and prepared the equipment models to use them.
			<li>Some non-static objects cast custom soft-shadow decals.
			<li>I created specific reflections cubemaps for 
				many non-static objects to prevent incorrect specular highlights.
			<li>Lighting is baked directly into equipment textures
				since I know each only appears once. 
	</ul>

	<p>
		These virtual tools are close matches to their real counterparts.
		After learning with this virtual lab, a student should 
		easily be able to use the real equipment.
		I made several visits to the lab while working on these assets
		to use the real equipment myself and record plenty of reference material.

	<p>
		The lab runs in a browser and is optimized for low-spec devices
		such as Chromebooks and tablets.
		There are max 25,000 triangles rendered across 22 draw events.
		The lab's load size is just under 50mb.

	<p>
		Built on Unity, I'm responsible for most of this project's scripting.
		This includes the UI, 3D equipment controls, object manipulation, 
		cable management, camera framing, and data graphing. 
		Like the 3D artwork, everything is profiled and optimized for low-spec devices.
	</p>

	</a>
	
	<p>
		I built systems in separate assemblies so that 
		I could re-use them in other virtual lab projects.
		These individual assemblies have come in handy on several other projects.
		UnityEvents suffice to glue these together without becoming unwieldy 
		as this project is relatively small.
	</p>

	<p>
		Building good UX around equipment's 3D controls was a challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
		Supporting a variety of devices means supporting a variety of aspect ratios. 
		I built a camera system for 'frames' that the user can navigate between. 
		Frames position the camera so that anything within the frame is always visible
		regardless of aspect ratio.
	</p>
	<p>
		The controls also must be large enough for the user to easily
		interact with them, so the different camera frames are arranged to 
		keep these controls at sane sizes. 
		The equipment is also arranged to keep related frames
		and controls within reach of one another.
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/editor3.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/editor3.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		Running on web-assembly, the lab must run on a single thread
		and cannot leverage Unity's Burst compiler.
		Optimizing for speed and avoiding allocations &amp; garbage was crucial 
		for the large amount of generated and sampled data.
		While performance is more than acceptable, 
		I'll likely re-implement the signal processing code 
		in shaders for future lab extensions.
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/editor.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/editor.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		The only scripting that I wasn't entirely responsible for
		was the equipment signal processing code.
		I collaborated with Prof. Chatzidakis and his team to
		model this equipment as I am neither an 
		electrical engineer nor one of his nuclear engineering students.
		I also wasn't responsible for the cable dynamics, as these are done with
		<a href="http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/" target="_blank">Obi Rope</a>.
