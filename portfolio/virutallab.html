	<h2>tl;dr</h2>
	<p>
		This is a virtual lab where I'm responsible for nearly all visuals and programming.
		I built the lab in Unity and created the visuals using Blender, Substance Painter,
		Marmoset Toolbag, and Affinity Designer.
		The project was led by Purdue University Prof. Stylianos Chatzidakis to increase
		access to curriculum-necessary lab equipment.
	</p>
	
	<h2>3D artwork</h2>
	
	<p>
		I was responsible for the lab's 3D models. 
		The program is designed so that a student should be able to easily
		use the real equipment after learning on its virtual counterparts.
		The models are referenced from dozens of pictures
		taken during visits to the lab.
		<!-- I decorated these models with the same labels, stickers, stains, 
		and scratches that grace their real counterparts. -->
	</p>
	
	<p>
		These were all made using Blender, 
		Substance Painter, and Marmoset Toolbag.
		Light is baked into all static meshes using Blender Cycles. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The program runs in a browser and is optimized for low-spec devices
		such as Chromebooks and tablets.
		There are max 25k triangles rendered in 22 draw events.
		The program's load size is shy of 50mb.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Programming</h2>
	
	<p>
		Built on Unity, I'm responsible for most of this project's scripting.
		This includes UI, UX, object manipulation, cable management, 
		camera framing, and data graphing. Like the models, everything is 
		profiled and optimized for low-spec devices.
	</p>

	<p>
		Optimizing for speed and avoiding garbage was crucial 
		for the large amount of generated and sampled data.
		Running on web-assembly, this has to run on a single thread
		and cannot leverage Unity's Burst compiler. 
		While performance is more than acceptable, 
		I'm eventually going to re-implement the equipment behavior in shaders.
	</p>

	<p>
		The only programming that I wasn't entirely responsible for
		was the equipment signal processing code.
		I collaborated with Prof. Chatzidakis and his team to
		model this equipment as I am neither an 
		electrical engineer nor one of his nuclear engineering students.
		I also wasn't responsible for the cable dynamics, as these are done with
