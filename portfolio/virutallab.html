	<p>
		This is a virtual lab project led by Purdue University Prof. Stylianos Chatzidakis.
		It increases accessibility to curriculum-necessary radiation spectrum analysis equipment
		with a web-simulated lab space.
		Built on Unity, I'm responsible for nearly all visuals and scripting.

	<p>
		A lot of care went into the visuals and user interaction to teach
		students how to properly use the equipment. 
		Users don't interface with 2D abstractions of this equipment but instead 
		press buttons, flip switches, and turn knobs on accurate 3D representations. 
		I decorated these with the same labels, stickers, stains, 
		and scratches that grace their real counterparts.
	</p>
	<p>
		The program runs in a browser and is optimized for low-spec devices
		such as Chromebooks and tablets.
		There are max 25k triangles rendered in 22 draw events.
		The program's load size is shy of 50mb.

	<p>
		I collaborated with Prof. Chatzidakis and his team to
		simulate the equipment via Unity scripting.
		The program is a flexible 'sandbox' that will deal with any 
		arrangements the user may configure.
		Inputs & outputs are fully simulated and everything interacts realistically.
		Tools are modular scripts, 
		making it easy to expand the lab with new equipment in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		A lot of thought went into this program's architecture, 
		leading to modular systems that communicate through delegates and Unity events.
		I've already reused many of them for other virtual lab projects
		because of how modular these systems are.
		Only a fraction of these scripts are truly specific to this virtual lab 
		and couldn't be useful in other projects.
	</p>

	<p>
		I am continuing to collaborate with Prof. Chatzidakis and his team 
		to expand the lab with more equipment and to cover more of his curriculum.
		I am also working on detailed documentation so that
		other developers may start building off of it.

	<p>
		While a lot of the lab is bespoke, including its plug & port system, object interaction,
		graphing tools and UI, I still used several third party assets. 
		The cable dynamics come from 
		<a href="http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/" target="_blank">Obi Rope</a>,
		and the radioactive source container model comes from 
		<a href="https://polyhaven.com/a/Barrel_01" target="_blank">PolyHaven</a>.
		The lab is built in Unity and most of the visuals were done in Blender, Substance Painter,
		Marmoset Toolbag, and Affinity Designer.
