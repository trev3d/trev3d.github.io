	<h2>tl;dr</h2>
	<p>
		This is a virtual lab for nuclear engineering undergrads.
		I'm responsible for all design, artwork, and (nearly all) programming;
		I built the lab in Unity and created the visuals
		in Blender, Marmoset Toolbag, Substance Painter, and Affinity Designer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Purdue University Prof. Stylianos Chatzidakis led this project to increase
		access to curriculum-necessary lab equipment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Completed late 2023
	</p>
	
	<h2>3D artwork</h2>
	
	<div class="webvid verticalvid">

	</div>

	<a href="virtuallab/real.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/real.jpg"></a>
	
	<p>
		These appliances are close matches to their real counterparts, 
		so a student should be able to use the real equipment after using this.
		All of the controls (knobs, dials, switches, etc) 
		are fully functional.
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/Screenshot_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/Screenshot_2.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		The lab runs in a browser and is optimized for low-spec devices
		such as Chromebooks and tablets.
		There are max 25,000 triangles rendered across 22 draw events.
		The lab's load size is just under 50mb.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some subtle details in the models:
		<ul>
			<li>Texel density is lower on obscured or unseen faces.
			<li>Lighting is baked directly into unlit equipment materials using 
				Blender / Cycles since each only appears once.
			<li>I created specific reflection cubemaps for many non-static 
				buttons and dials to prevent incorrect specular highlights.
			<li>Some movable objects drop soft-shadow decals to make their position
			easier to read.
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>programming</h2>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/editor2.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/editor2.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		Built in Unity, I'm responsible for most of this project's scripting
		(UI, 3D equipment controls, object manipulation, 
		cable management, camera framing, data graphing, etc, etc). 
		Like the 3D artwork, everything is profiled and optimized for low-spec devices.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Signal processing and equipment simulation:</h3>
	
	<p>
		Each tool simulates signal processing on voltage curve functions. 
		With the help of Prof. Chatzidakis and his team, 
		I modeled the equipment behavior in C#.
	</p>
	
	<video autoplay muted playsinline loop 
			src="virtuallab/samples.mp4"
			style="width:100%; max-height:300px; margin:auto;"></video>
	
	<p>
		The lab targets 100,000 data samples per second,
		each a voltage curve signal processed by the equipment.
		Being a web app, I'm limited to a single CPU core 
		and can't use Unity's Burst compiler.
		Even so, low-spec devices run the simulation at full speed.
	</p>
	
	<video autoplay muted playsinline loop 
			src="virtuallab/graph.mp4"
			style="width:100%; max-height:300px; margin:auto;"></video>
	
	<p>
		The data histogram and oscilloscope line graph displays
		are shaders. Some equipment will write incoming 
		data to textures that these shaders display as a graph.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Cable visuals and performance:</h3>
	
	<p>
		For cable physics I use
		<a href="http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/" target="_blank">Obi Rope</a>.
		My Obi settings are tuned for a decent balance between visual quality and performance.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		Cable mesh updates are expensive;
		time increases linearly with vertex count.
		I use flat ribbon meshes with cylindrical normals 
		to minimize vert count. 
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/cables.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/cables.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		I randomize cable colors so users can keep track of
		what is connected to what.
		All cables use the same material with different vertex colors.
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/dither.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/dither.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		The cables become semi-transparent via dithering
		when they may obscure important elements.
	</p>
		
	<br>
	<h3>User experience in 3D:</h3>
	
	<p>
		The user shouldn't lose draggables behind other objects or
		off screen, so 
		the user cannot drop objects behind UI elements,
		outside of the camera bounds, or while the camera is moving.
	</p>
	<p>
		Held objects position using rigidbody-casts so that they don't 
		visually clip into their surroundings.
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/editor3.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/editor3.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		I need to support arbitrary aspect ratios, 
		so I wrote an editor tool for creating camera 'frames.' 
		These keep important objects visible no matter the display aspect. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Controls must be large enough for easy interaction, 
		so I position frames to	keep controls at sane screen-sizes. 
		I also keep related frames
		and controls close together.
	</p>

	<!--<p>
		The only scripting that I wasn't entirely responsible for
		was the equipment signal processing code.
		I collaborated with Prof. Chatzidakis and his team to
		model this equipment as I am neither an 
		electrical engineer nor one of his nuclear engineering students.
		I also wasn't responsible for the cable dynamics, as these are done with
		<a href="http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/" target="_blank">Obi Rope</a>.
