	<h2>tl;dr</h2>
	<p>
		This is a virtual lab for nuclear engineering undergrads.
		I'm responsible for the design, artwork, and (nearly all) programming;
		I built the lab in Unity and created the visuals
		in Blender, Marmoset Toolbag, Substance Painter, and Affinity Designer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Purdue University Prof. Stylianos Chatzidakis led this project to increase
		access to curriculum-necessary lab equipment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Completed late 2023
	</p>
	
	<h2>3D artwork</h2>

	<p>
		The lab runs in a browser and is optimized for low-spec devices
		such as Chromebooks and tablets.
		There are max 25,000 triangles rendered across 22 draw events.
		The lab's load size is just under 50mb.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some subtle details in the models:
		<ul>
			<li>Texel density is lower on obscured or unseen faces.
			<li>Lighting is baked directly into unlit equipment materials using 
				Blender / Cycles since each only appears once.
			<li>I created specific reflection cubemaps for many non-static 
				buttons and dials to prevent incorrect specular highlights.
			<li>Some movable objects drop soft-shadow decals to make their position
			easier to read.
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		All of the equipment controls are modeled and fully functional.

	<h2>programming</h2>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/editor2.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/editor2.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		Built in Unity, I'm responsible for all of this project's scripting
		(minus cable physics). 
		Like the 3D artwork, everything is profiled and optimized for low-spec devices.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Signal processing and equipment simulation:</h3>
	
	<p>
		Each appliance is functional and 
		simulates inputs and outputs with voltage curve functions. 
		With the help of Prof. Chatzidakis and his team, 
		I modeled each equipment's behavior in code.
	</p>
	
	<video autoplay muted playsinline loop 
			src="virtuallab/samples.mp4"
			style="width:100%; max-height:300px; margin:auto;"></video>
	
	<p>
		The lab targets 100,000 data samples per second,
		each processed by the equipment.
		Being a web-assembly app, I'm limited to a single CPU core 
		and can't use Unity's Burst compiler.
		Even so, low-spec devices run the simulation at full speed.
	</p>
	
	<video autoplay muted playsinline loop 
			src="virtuallab/graph.mp4"
			style="width:100%; max-height:300px; margin:auto;"></video>
	
	<p>
		The data histogram and oscilloscope line graph displays
		are shaders. Some equipment will write incoming 
		data to textures that these shaders display as a graph.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Cable visuals and performance:</h3>
	
	<p>
		For cable physics I use
		<a href="http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/" target="_blank">Obi Rope</a>.
		My Obi settings are tuned for a decent balance between visual quality and performance.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		Cable mesh updates are expensive;
		time increases linearly with vertex count.
		I use flat ribbon meshes with cylindrical normals 
		to minimize vert count. 
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/cables.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/cables.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		Cable vertex colors are random
		so that users can keep track of what is connected to what.
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/dither.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/dither.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		The cables become semi-transparent via dithering
		when they may obscure important elements.
	</p>
		
	<br>
	<h3>UX in 3D:</h3>
	
	<p>
		The user shouldn't lose draggable objects behind other objects or
		off screen, so 
		I don't allow dropping objects behind UI elements,
		outside of the camera bounds, or while the camera is moving.
	</p>
	
	<a href="virtuallab/editor3.png" target="_blank"><img src="virtuallab/editor3.png"></a>
	
	<p>
		Camera 'frames' keep important objects in view 
		regardless of aspect ratio.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Controls must be large enough for easy interaction, 
		so I position frames to	keep controls at sane screen-sizes. 
		I also keep related frames
		and controls close together.
	</p>
