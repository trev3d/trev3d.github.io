    <h1>hello world</h1>
    <p>
		My name is Julian Triveri. I'm a undergrad at Purdue University 
		and an employee at a 
		<a href="https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/envision">university run visualization lab</a>.
		Several projects shown on this site come from my work there.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I have experience in realtime 3D art, basic animation, and high-level programming, and I'm currently
		expanding my skillset to include graphics and low-level programming.
    </p>
	
    <p>
		While I believe that form should always follow function,
		I still have a keen interest in design and aesthetics.
		I especially love creating refined visuals for 
		performace-constrained platforms such as web and mobile VR. 
		Working within such constraints requires a more human touch
		where problem solving and clever tricks make all the difference. 
		Squeezing an unexpected level of performance out of a relatively
		weak device is a fun challenge, and it is why I'm increasingly exploring 
		topics in graphics programming and low-level code.
