    <h1>hello world</h1>
    <p>
		My name is Julian Triveri. I'm a undergrad at Purdue University 
		and an employee at a 
		<a href="https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/envision">university run visualization lab</a>.
		Several projects shown on this site come from my work there.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I have experience in realtime 3D art, basic animation, and high-level programming, and I'm currently
		expanding my skillset to include graphics and low-level programming.
    </p>
	
    <p>
		While I believe that form should always follow function,
		I still have a keen interest in design and aesthetics.
		I especially love creating refined visuals for 
		performace-constrained platforms such as web and mobile VR. 
		Working within such constraints requires a more human touch
		where problem solving and clever tricks make all the difference. 
    </p>
	<p>
		If I can be candid and a little unprofessional for a moment, 
		I want to admit that I often ask myself whether my work matters that much.
		The world is full of many important problems, 
		few of which are solved by computer nerds who can
		make pretty pictures. 
		If you are someone who is working on something important
		and impactful and my sort of work would somehow
		help your effort, please do not hesitate to contact me.
		I would rather sink my time and effort into things that truly matter.
	</p>
