    <h1>hello world</h1>
    <p>
		My name is Julian Triveri. I'm a undergrad at Purdue University 
		and an employee at a 
		<a href="https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/envision">university run visualization lab</a>.
		Several projects shown on this site come from my work there.
    </p>
	
    <p>
		While I believe that form should always follow function,
		I still have a keen interest in design and aesthetics.
		I especially love creating refined visuals for 
		performace-constrained platforms such as web and mobile VR. 
		Such constraints ask for more of a personal human touch to work within, and
		my ultimate goal is to make people ask "how did they do this with that?!"
