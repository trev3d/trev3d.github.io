    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>
		My name is Julian Triveri. I'm a undergrad at Purdue University 
		and a full-time associate research software engineer at the 
		<a href="https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/envision">Purdue Envision Center</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I have experience in real-time 3D art, basic animation, and high-level programming, and I'm currently
		expanding my skill-set to include graphics and low-level programming.
    </p>
	
    <p>
		While I believe that form should always follow function,
		I still have a keen interest in design and aesthetics.
		I especially love creating refined visuals for 
		performance-constrained platforms such as web and mobile VR. 
		Working within such constraints requires a more human touch
		where problem solving and clever tricks make all the difference. 
    </p>

	<!-- <p> 
		If I can be candid and a little unprofessional for a moment, 
		I want to admit that I often ask myself whether my work matters that much.
		The world is full of many important problems, 
		few of which are solved by computer nerds who make pretty pictures. 
		If you are someone who is working on something important and impactful 
		and my sort of work would somehow help your effort, 
		please do not hesitate to contact me.
		I would love to work with you and 
		sink my time and effort into things that truly matter.
