    <h1>hello world</h1>
    <p>
		My name is Julian Triveri. I'm a undergrad at Purdue University 
		and an employee at a 
		<a href="https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/envision">university run visualization lab</a>.
		Several projects shown on this site come from my work there.
    </p>
	
    <p>
        I love interactive media, but I want to work on things
		that help people more directly than through entertainment alone.
		Scientific visualization and virtual education are my current focuses.
    </p>
    <p>
		That said, I still have a keen interest in design and aesthetics.
        While I believe that form should always follow function, 
		I still love giving my work polished visuals when appropriate.
