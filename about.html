    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
		I'm Julian Triveri, a
		full-time tech artist at the 
		<a href="https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/envision">
		Purdue Envision Center  â†’</a>
		and a part-time undergrad at Purdue University in the US. 
		I wear many hats and I'm always looking for new ones to try on.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm a capable high-level programmer, 3D modeler, and cellist. 
		I'm still a fledgling low-level / graphics programmer. 
		I do a lot of stuff with VR.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I believe that form should always follow function,
		but I still have a keen interest in design and aesthetics.
	</p>
	<p>
		I like creating unexpectedly refined visuals for 
		performance-constrained platforms such as web and mobile VR. 
		Working within constraints requires a more human touch
		where creative problem solving and clever tricks make all the difference. 
    </p>

	<!-- <p> 
		If I can be candid and a little unprofessional for a moment, 
		I want to admit that I often ask myself whether my work matters that much.
		The world is full of many important problems, 
		few of which are solved by computer nerds who make pretty pictures. 
		If you are someone who is working on something important and impactful 
		and my sort of work would somehow help your effort, 
		please do not hesitate to contact me.
		I would love to work with you and 
		sink my time and effort into things that truly matter.
