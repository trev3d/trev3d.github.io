<p>I have one rule for this. When I type anything it stays. There will be no going back
to revise things. I need to do this without overthinking.
	
<p>On Friday Nov 8th, at some time before 7pm, my best friend,
Ernesto Tangassi Lucio, shot himself. He later died early Sunday.
	
<p>I don't really know how to honor someone in a way that feels completely sincere
publicly on the internet. I talked just last week to Ernesto about how I felt
nothing I did really felt truly pure; everything I did was always, in one way or another,
done to impress someone else or to get attention. 
If it is possible for something to truly be pure then it should be this webpage.

<p>I'm not meaning to pick favorites when I call him my 'best friend.'
I call him my best friend because I felt like he understood me in ways that nobody
else has. He was accepting of both my best and my worst traits, and I could be candid
with him like nobody else. It's funny because if something this bad were ever to happen,
he'd be the one I'd reach out to to talk about it. It's a lot like that LCD Soundsystem
song. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLS5w43H-ik" target="_blank">
"I wish that we could talk about it. But there, that's the problem." </a>

<p>I wish I could joke about this whole situation with him. 
He would find it funny. We had that sort of raport.

<p>He was one of the most level-headed, smartest, most creative, interesting people I've
ever known. I clicked with him in a way that I've never clicked with anyone. 
We were on the same wavelength. We could talk for hours and we often did.

<p>Is there such a thing as mourning someone publicly in a pure manner?
Am I actually just doing this for attention? I'm thinking about some of my favorite
songs about dead loved ones, like that LCD Soundsystem song, or Mark Kozelek singing
about his second cousin Carissa. These are touching pieces of public grief but
they were also <i>sold</i>. Are those musicians 'using' loved one's deaths 
for their own benefit? Am I writing and publishing this for some selfish purpose?
To gain attention or sympathy?

<p>See, this is why I miss him so much. These are the sort of predicaments we'd like
to talk or joke about. He would have insightful things to say about this.

<p>I just miss him so much. All of us do. It came so suddenly. It still really hasn't
set in for me. What the fuck are we supposed to do?

<p>I don't know how to talk or write, especially about something like this.
I need to say something though. It's just so fucked. So so fucked.

<p>That's how it goes though. Time marches on and there are no revisions. That's the rule.

<p>Ernesto I don't have the words to say how much I miss you, 
and I'm still kind of only in shock. I trust that you know what I was getting at here.
All of us send you our best wishes. I'm just clumsy. You know this.

<p>I'm never going to see you again. None of us are. I tell myself this over and over
but I still don't believe it. 

<p>I'm never going to see you make your surprise visits to my office and provide
a brief reprieve from my spending all day in front of a computer. I'm never going to
see you jot something down or make a little sketch in your notebook. I'm never again
going to be able to buy you a Jones cream soda, or invite you to a movie night,
or work on artwork for the lasertag game, or test some new project, or see a new
art piece you drew. I'll never get to ask you to critique some character model I'm 
working on. I never even finished a single thing for you. I'll never get to 
go on a long walk with you through Purdue's Utility plant talking about whatever is on
our minds. I'll never again get to tape a mazapan to Hazel's drone and fly it into your
hands, or get a random sketch from you, something I never reciprocated and now never can.
I'll never get to attend one of your perler bead events that you held because the 
University forced you, as an RA, to hold social events for your floor even though nobody 
ever attended them and I never did because I'd sleep in every Saturday and miss them.
I'll never see that signature bike helmet of yours full of stickers. I want to photoscan
that helmet and preserve it forever. I'll never receive another 'bom dia' gif from you, 
a funny callback to you talking about Latin American aunts and grandmothers. 
I'll never get to sit down and talk while watching you draw something fantastic.
I should have been a better friend while you were still here, and I will be a better
friend to everyone else in your honor. I will try my best. I know, Ernesto, 
you said I was a good friend, but just take my word for it that I could have been better. 
I will kill all of my ego and snark. And if I ever forget to then I'll rectify it as soon 
as I remember you and this promise that I made to you.

<p>I'm sitting here in the hotel bathroom typing this. The lights are off and the shower
is on; it's set to cold because I don't want to waste warm water and I have my jacket on.
It's not like one of those cheesy movie scenes though where someone is all
depressed and crying with the shower on. Instead it's because of this thing called
'water sounds.' I wish I could tell you about what 'water sounds' was. I think
you would have liked it.

<p>It was raining when we first got the news. We still thought you were going to make it
at that point. Us sitting in the car with the lights off, 
hearing the rain patter on the roof. It was the essence of 'water sounds.' 
You would have loved sitting in my place I think.

<p>I lit a candle for you at Saint Tom's. I'll light several more probably.
I said prayers for you and your family; your siblings and your parents. I will say more.
I can't imagine how they feel. I am devastated for them. 

<p>You too were one of a kind. Cheers dude. I forgive you. It's all good.</p>
